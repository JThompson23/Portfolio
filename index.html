            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Justin Thompson and this is a little bit about myself. I grew up in Jacksboro, Texas where I excelled in many different things including sports and my studies. I graduated High School and moved on to college at Texas State University. While there, I worked full time as a bartender at multiple locations whilst completing my bachelors degree in Exercise and Sports Science. During this time, I also studied psychology as my minor, and tried multiple majors including Computer Science but could not get into it at the time.</p>
            <p>After I graduated college, I moved to Houston for a year, and then moved back to the San Antonio area to pursue a career in criminal justice. I worked for a company called CoreCivic for 6 years and held many titles including Residential Supervisor, Senior Resident Supervisor, and Learning and Development Manager. All of these positions had their challenges, and eventually all lead to me developing new skills and developing old ones. I am now working on creating multiple projects in order to pursue a career in coding.</p>
